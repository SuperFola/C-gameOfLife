# C-gameOfLife

A small game of life project created in C for learning purpose, and also because
that's funny to see how something can evolve.

## Building

`gcc main.c -Wall -std=c99`

## Running

With an argument (a file with a 32x32 matrix) or no argument (matrix generated
randomly).

`./a.out all.gol` will run the `all.gol` file
